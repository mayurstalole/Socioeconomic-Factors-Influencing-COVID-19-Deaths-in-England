This project explores the relationship between various socioeconomic factors and COVID-19 death rates across different regions of England. The analysis is based on real-world data from the UK Census, focusing on variables such as age, dwelling type, and health condition. Using statistical methods such as correlation analysis, factor analysis, and multiple regression, this project aims to uncover patterns and insights into how these factors contributed to COVID-19 mortality rates.
